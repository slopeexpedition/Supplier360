# Supplier360
An incentivized climate friendly network.

As per McKinsey, 50% of the revenue of the Supply Chain is being impacted because of the non-optimal processes with the Suppliers and the supply chain network

The need of the hour is to build and establish a mechanism to the
Suppliers based on the Climate friendly metrics they adhere to like:
	
	Greenhouse gas emission
	Water use
	Energy consumption and reduction
	Waste production and recycling rate
	Usage of plastic
	Carbon offsetting

An optimal solution is to ‘extend’ the existing supply chain solutions to include climate metrics and drive incentivization and discipline mechanisms based on the various metrics

We will leverage a full set of Rapyd API in developing a high-quality solution and building the Web solution which will calculate the rewards and ‘disburse’ with Rapyd gateway and also ‘collect’ the disciplined amount – all over an escrow wallet.

The Data: We are loading 1 Million Suppliers in eight major supply chain industries with various performance parameters like plastic usage, water usage, carbon offsetting, waste disposal, recycling, etc. over 5 years

We have extended the supplier performance metrics system to include sustainability metrics along with performance metrics. These metrics will enable our application supplier360 to pay incentives or collect disciplinary amounts based on a threshold sustainability score with is automatically calculated by taking the mean of the weighted average of all the climate metrics over the past years.
